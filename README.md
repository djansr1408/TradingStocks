# Trading Stocks using LSTM
This project is about predicting stock prices using LSTM neural network and implementing simple trading strategy.

## Introduction

Developing trading strategy is quite challenging task because of variety of approaches that could be applied. Some of the mostly used are: momentum strategy, reversion strategy and forecasting strategy.
For this assignment, I will use forecasting strategy combined with deep learning. The main idea is to predict the next value of a stock based on some historical factors (data).
